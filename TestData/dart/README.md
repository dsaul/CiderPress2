# DART Samples #

This contains disk images generated with DART v1.5.3 running on an
emulated Macintosh in MAME.

"test1" is an 800KB disk with the DART application on it.  A 1440KB disk
image has two DART files, compressed with "fast" and "best".  There's another
copy of the disk image in the ZIP to test disk image recognition.

"random_t" is an 800KB disk with two 256KB files filled with uncompressible
junk.  The tag bytes have also been filled with random junk.  This can be
used to test the behavior of DART when encountering uncompressible chunks.
A 1440KB disk image has two DART files, compressed with "fast" and "best".
