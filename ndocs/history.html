<h1>CiderPress History</h1>

<p>The true origin of CiderPress is a program called "NuView", the NuFX
Archive Viewer.  Written in May 1989, it printed a list of files from a ShrinkIt
archive.  This was also of note because it's the first useful program
(i.e. not a class project) I ever wrote in the C programming language.</p>
<p>This project gradually evolved into a program called "NuLib", which continued
to grow until 1992.
In 1998 I started working on a NuFX archive manipulation library, called
NufxLib.  That was a back-burner project until it was finally released
with the NuLib2 archiver in May 2000.</p>

<p>In December 2002 I decided to start working on Windows software.
The original CiderPress was introduced in March 2003 as a shareware
application.  It was originally intended as "ShrinkIt for Windows",
a simple GUI wrapper around the NufxLib library, but during the early stages
of development support for read-only access to disk images was added.</p>
<p>In October 2004, CiderPress v2.0 was released.  It added the ability
to create and modify disk images, and allowed direct access to physical media.</p>
<p>Four years after its initial release, in March 2007, the program
was re-released as free open-source software.  In January 2015, the code
base was updated for modern systems, but at its heart it was still a
Windows 98/2K 32-bit application.</p>

<p>Work on CiderPress II began in May 2022, mostly out of frustration with
the awkwardness of the user interface of the original.
Another goal was to have a full set of features available from the
command line, including file converters.  The original CiderPress had a
few sample commands that ran under Linux, but nothing actually useful.</p>
<p>The first public announcement was made a year later, in May 2023, at a
point where the CLI was in good shape but the GUI was barely functional.
Version 1.0 was released in December 2023.</p>

<p>Depending on how you figure things, this might be the 5th time I've
written the same project.  It just gets a bit larger and broader in
scope each time.</p>
