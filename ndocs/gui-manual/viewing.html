<h2>Viewing Files</h2>

<p>The file viewer can display the contents of a file read from a file archive or
disk image in various forms.  Two basic conversion modes, plain text and hex dump,
are available for all types of files.  The converted output usually appears in the
<samp>Data Fork</samp> tab.</p>

<p>The Plain Text converter does its best to display the contents of the file as text.
Control characters can be converted to Unicode "control pictures" or dumped in their
raw state (which is reasonable when exporting to a file but not recommended for the
internal file viewer).  Some control characters, such as carriage return and newline, are
converted to the local end-of-line character.  You can specify the character set to
use with the radio buttons, choosing whether the source is high/low ASCII (e.g. DOS 3.3),
Mac OS Roman (e.g. HFS), or ISO Latin-1 (e.g. documentation in a ZIP archive).</p>
<p>The Hex Dump converter displays the contents as hex values, 16 per line, with
printable values shown in a column on the right.  Control characters are replaced with
a dot glyph.  The character set can be chosen from the usual set.</p>

<p>Files with a resource fork will have a text dump of the contents available in
the <samp>Resource Fork</samp> tab.

<p>The <samp>Notes</samp> tab will be enabled if the file converter found something
of interest.  This could be comments embedded in the file, information about the file
format, or complaints about errors found during processing.</p>

<p>The arrow buttons at the left and right sides of the window can be used to move
to adjacent files.  If you selected multiple files before opening the file viewer,
only those files will be available to view.  If only one file was selected, the
buttons will move between all files that were shown in the file list panel.</p>


<h2>Conversions</h2>

<p>Many files will have a specific conversion available.  Word processor documents,
spreadsheets, and graphical images can be converted to a more modern format.  There are
four types of output:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Simple text.  Exports as .TXT.</li>
  <li>Fancy text.  Text with formatting, such as changes to font size, style, and color.
    Exports as .RTF.</li>
  <li>Cell grid.  Used for spreadsheets and some database files, including random-access
    text files on DOS 3.3 disks.  Exports as .CSV.</li>
  <li>Bitmap.  Used for anything graphical.  Exports as .PNG.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically there is a fifth type, "host image", which is used for GIF, JPEG, and
PNG files.  These can be displayed directly by the Windows application, so there's no
need to convert them first.  For <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.rtf</code>, and Word documents
identified by HFS file type, the file will be extracted to a temporary file and displayed
with the system's default handler for the <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.rtf</code>, or
<code>.doc</code> filename extension.</p>

<p>The set of conversions that can be applied to a file are determined automatically,
and placed in the <samp>Conversion</samp> pop-up menu.  They will be sorted by
applicability, with the best option at the top (clicking the <samp>Best</samp> button selects
the top item in the list).  Selecting a new conversion causes
the contents to be reformatted and displayed.</p>
<p>A conversion may have options associated with it.  For example, Plain Text allows you
to select the character encoding, while Apple II Hi-Res Image has a checkbox that
selects black &amp; white or color.  The options you select are temporary, unless you
click the <samp>Save As Default Configuration</samp> button, which will save them in
the settings file as the file viewer default.</p>

<p>When viewing a text file, the <samp>Find</samp> box will be available.  This allows
you to search forward or backward through the text for a simple text string.</p>

<p>When viewing a bitmap, the <samp>Graphics Zoom</samp> slider will be available.  This
scales the image in the viewer, allowing you to zoom in on part of an image.</p>

<p>The <samp>Open Raw</samp> button only affects DOS 3.3 files.  It allows files with
types T, I, A, and B to be opened as a series of 256-byte sectors, so you can see the
file headers and the data stored past the declared end of file.  Selecting this is usually
required for random-access text files, which will ordinarily appear truncated or empty.  When
this is checked, some of the standard file viewers won't work, e.g. you won't be able to get a
formatted listing of an Applesoft BASIC program because the file now starts with an
additional header.</p>


<h2>Copy and Export</h2>

<p>Converted files can be exported directly from the file viewer.  There are two ways
to do this.</p>

<p>Clicking the <samp>Export</samp> button opens a file save dialog.  A filename, based
on the file being viewed and the conversion type, will be filled in as the default value.
Select a location for the file and click <samp>Save</samp>.</p>
<p>Clicking the <samp>Copy</samp> button copies the file to the system clipboard.  It
can be pasted directly into other applications.  For fancy text documents, the
conversion will be available as both plain text and formatted text, allowing the
receiving program to pick whichever is best suited.</p>
<p>It's also possible to select a range of text in the viewer window and copy that
to the clipboard with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>.</p>

<p>The export will reflect the current state of the file viewer.  Whichever converter
and options you have chosen will be used when generating the output file.  If you
have selected the <samp>Resource Fork</samp> or <samp>Notes</samp> tab, the contents
of that tab will be exported.</p>
<p>The only exception to this is that the <samp>Graphics Zoom</samp> setting is ignored.
Graphics are always exported at the base resolution.</p>
