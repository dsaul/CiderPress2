<h2>Opening Archives</h2>

<p>When CiderPress II starts, you will see a plain window with menu items, a toolbar
near the top, and a few buttons in the middle.  The
buttons allow you to open an existing file or create a new file.  If you have
worked with files in the past, there will also be buttons that reopen recently-opened
files.</p>
<p>The same features can be accessed with the <samp>File &gt; Open</samp>,
<samp>File &gt; New Disk Image</samp>, <samp>File &gt; New File Archive</samp>,
and <samp>File &gt; Recent Files</samp> menu items.</p>
<p>You can also open a file by dragging it from Windows Explorer and dropping it
on this window.</p>

<p>It's possible to bypass the opening screen entirely.  You can do this by dragging
and dropping a file onto the CiderPress II application icon, or by double-clicking
on a file when CiderPress II is configured as the default application for that
file extension.  To do the latter in Windows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on a file of the appropriate type, and select <samp>Open with</samp>
  and the <samp>Choose another app</samp> option.</li>
  <li>In the window that pops up, select the <samp>CiderPress2</samp> application,
  and check the "always use this app to open files" box.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the contents of the file are analyzed to see if they can be
recognized as a supported archive type.  If the filename has a known extension,
such as ".zip", the file will be rejected if the contents don't match.</p>
<p>Archives can be scanned automatically to see if they contain other archives.
The setting of the "Auto-Open Depth" option will determine if and how deeply
this process is performed.  At its maximum setting, all archive contents will
be scanned recursively, which can take a few seconds on large collections.</p>


<h2>Getting Around</h2>

<p>When an archive is open, the main area of the window is divided into four regions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Top left: archive contents.</li>
  <li>Bottom left: directory hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Center: file list or archive info.</li>
  <li>Right: add/extract/import/export settings.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Archive Contents</h3>

<p>The top-left window shows a hierarchical view of the contents of the disk image
or file archive.  For a simple file archive this will only have one entry, while a
disk image will usually have two: one for the disk image file, and one for the
filesystem.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on an entry switches the focus to that entity.  This will cause the
contents of the other windows to be updated appropriately.</p>

<p>There are five kinds of entries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>File archive.  ZIP, ShrinkIt, etc.  These are simple linear lists of files,
    and so do not have a directory structure.</li>
  <li>Disk image.  DiskCopy, 2IMG, WOZ, etc.  This represents the image file itself,
    which may have editable metadata or comment fields.</li>
  <li>Multi-partition layout.  APM, UniDOS, etc.  This is for disk images that
    hold multiple partitions.</li>
  <li>Partition.  One partition in a multi-partition layout.</li>
  <li>Filesystem.  DOS, ProDOS, HFS, etc.  This is the contents of a disk image or
    partition, where the files are found.  If the filesytem is hierarchical,
    the Directory Hierarchy window will be populated with a directory tree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right-clicking on an entry will bring up a menu of actions.  Inappropriate actions
will be dimmed, e.g. you can't sector-edit a file archive.</p>

<p>Some disks have custom filesystems that can't be recognized.  So long as the disk
image format appears to be correct, the archive will be opened, but it won't have
a filesystem entry in the archive tree.</p>

<p>If you open a disk image or file archive inside another archive, it
will appear in the tree.</p>

<h3>Directory Hierarchy</h3>

<p>For most archives, the directory hierarchy tree will have a single place-holder
entry.  For ProDOS and HFS filesystems, it will have a directory tree instead.
The top entry represents the volume directory, and will show the volume name.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on an entry will select that directory.  The file list will be
updated appropriately.</p>
<p>Right-clicking on an entry will bring up a menu of actions.  Inappropriate actions
will be dimmed.</p>

<h3>File List / Info</h3>

<p>The contents of the center window change depending on what is selected in the
Archive Contents tree.<p>
<ul>
  <li>Disk images and partitions: geometry statistics, disk editing buttons,
    and optional metadata.</li>
  <li>Multi-partition layout: partition list.</li>
  <li>File archives and filesystems: a list of files.</li>
</ul>
<p>For disk images and partitions, a few basic statistics about disk size and
archive file layout are displayed, as well as some buttons that provide quick
access to sector editing and other whole-disk actions.</p>
<p>For multi-partition layouts, you will see a list of the partitions and their
attributes.  Double-clicking on an entry will jump to that partition.  If it
has a filesystem, the filesystem will be selected.</p>
<p>For filesystems and file archives, a list of the files found is shown.  The
list is divided into several columns, which will be shown or hidden depending
on what is being displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status icon - this will be blank for most entries.  If the entry has a
    comment, a "speech bubble" icon will be shown.  If the file scanner found
    some problems with the file, it will be marked "dubious" with a yellow
    triangle, indicating that it cannot be modified.  If the file is too
    damaged to be read, it will be marked with a red symbol.</li>
  <li>Pathname or Filename - file archives always show Pathname, non-hierarchical
    filesystems always show Filename.  Hierarchical filesytems will show one or
    the other depending on the display mode (see below).</li>
  <li>Type - ProDOS or HFS file type.  The most appropriate type is shown,
    based on the archive type and the file characteristics.</li>
  <li>Auxtype - ProDOS auxiliary type or HFS creator.</li>
  <li>Mod Date - date when file was last modified.  Shown in local time.</li>
  <li>Data Len - length of the data fork.</li>
  <li>Raw Len - "raw" length of the data fork.  Only shown for DOS 3.2/3.3 filesystems.</li>
  <li>Data Format - format of data fork storage, i.e. how it is compressed.
    Only shown for file archives.</li>
  <li>Rsrc Len - length of the resource fork.  Only shown for archives that support
    forked files.</li>
  <li>Rsrc Format - format of resource fork storage, i.e. how it is compressed.
    Only shown for file archives.</li>
  <li>Total Size - combined length of the data and resource forks, as well as any
    overhead.  This is the amount of storage used in the filesystem.  For a file
    archive, this is the sum of the compressed lengths, but does not include
    archive overhead.  The units used vary, e.g. DOS 3.3 is reported in 256-byte sectors,
    while ProDOS is reported in 512-byte blocks.</li>
  <li>Access - access flags.  Delete, reName, Write, Read, Backup, Invisible.
</ul>

<p>For file archives and filesystems, the file list display mode can be changed
with buttons in the toolbar or items in the <samp>View</samp> menu.  There are three
possible modes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Full-file: show all files in the archive, with full pathnames.</li>
  <li>Single-directory: show only the filenames of the files in a single directory.</li>
  <li>Archive info: replaces the file list with a set of information about the
    filesystem.  If you see a warning or error icon next to the filesystem entry
    in the archive tree, this screen will provide details about what was found.</li>
</ol>
<p>Switching between full-file and single-directory allows you to see the entire
contents of a hierarchical filesystem all at once, or focus in on a single directory.
File archives are always full-file, and non-hierarchical filesystems are always
single-directory.</p>

<p>Columns may be resized by clicking and dragging on the separators in the
column headers.  The column widths are saved in the application settings file.</p>
<p>The entries in the file list can be sorted by clicking on the column header.
Click again to reverse the direction of the sort.  To return to the original
order, i.e. the order in which the files are stored in the archive, use the reset
sort button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>Double-clicking on a directory entry in the file list will update the Directory
tree to have that entry selected.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a non-directory entry in the file list will usually open the
entry in the file viewer.
If the entry looks like a file archive or disk image, an attempt will first be made to open
it as such.  If the attempt succeeds, it will be added to the Archive Contents tree
and opened for viewing.
If you accidentally open a disk image or file archive without intending to do so,
you can close it by right-clicking on the entry in the Archive Contents tree and
selecting <samp>Close File Source</samp>.</p>

<p>Right-clicking on an entry brings up a menu of actions.</p>

<h3>Add/Extract/Import/Export Settings</h3>

<p>The rightmost window contains a set of options used when adding, extracting,
importing, or exporting files.  These are explained in detail in a later section
of the manual.</p>
<p>The window can be hidden with the <samp>Show/Hide Settings</samp> button.</p>


<h2>Additional Navigation</h2>

<p>The <samp>Navigate</samp> menu items allow you to navigate upward in the
tree.  Selecting the <samp>Go To Parent Directory</samp> item will change the
Directory tree selection to be one entry higher, stopping when it reaches the
volume directory.
The <samp>Go To Parent</samp> item performs the same action, but will continue
the upward movement in the Archive Contents tree if the Directory tree is at the top.</p>
<p>The toolbar button with the up-arrow icon performs the <samp>Go To Parent</samp>
action.</p>
