<h2>Drag &amp; Drop to Move Files</h2>

<p>Drag &amp; drop within the application can be used to move files from one directory to
another in disk images with hierarchical filesystems, such as ProDOS and HFS.</p>

<p>When moving files within a disk directory hierarchy, all selected files are transferred to the
target directory.  If you select a variety of files from multiple directories, all of them
will be moved to the destination.  If you want to retain the directory structure, move a
directory instead of the files inside it.</p>

<p>Unlike inter-application copies, the behavior is not affected by whether the display is
configured to show all files or only a single directory.</p>

<p>Dragging a file to the directory it already lives in has no effect.</p>

<p>Files may be dropped in the file list or directory tree.  If dropped in the file list, the
application checks to see if they were dropped on a directory entry.  If so, that directory will
be used as the destination; if not, the directory that is currently selected in the directory tree
will be used.</p>

<p>The order in which files appear in a directory can be important, so an effort is made to
preserve the order of the files.  They will generally be moved in the order in which they appear
in the file list on screen.</p>

<p>Copy &amp; paste within a file archive is not permitted, because it's not possible to read
from an entry while modifying the archive.  Copy & paste within a disk image is allowed, but
attempting to copy a file onto itself will fail.</p>


<h2>Drag / Copy Between Applications</h2>

<p>Inter-application Drag and Copy operations can be initiated from the file list.  They two have
identical behavior behind the scenes: in both cases, a collection of "virtual" file references and
metadata is collected and provided to Windows.  The file data itself is not copied to the
clipboard.  Using virtual file streams improves performance when starting a drag or copy
operation, and allows files to be dragged or pasted directly into "foreign" applications, such as
Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>Data is read from the virtual streams at the time the files are dropped or pasted.  Because of
this, files copied onto the clipboard cannot be pasted after the source archive or disk image is
closed.  Similarly, files copied to the clipboard cannot be pasted if they are deleted from a
disk image or file archive after being copied.  This means you can't copy files between disk
images by opening the first image, copying the data, closing it, and then opening the second image
to do the paste.</p>

<p>The application has no ability to influence how Windows Explorer handles the clipboard data
prepared for "foreign" transfers, so the file data must be arranged in the clipboard in a way that
allows it to be written to Windows without further action.  This requires separating data and
resource forks into separate file entries, with filenames and file contents appropriate for Windows
and the currently-selected attribute preservation system (NAPS, AppleSingle, etc).</p>

<p>When dragging or copying between instances of CiderPress II, a different set of metadata and
virtual file streams is used.  These copy both forks and all file attributes.  Certain options,
such as "strip paths" and "use raw data", will change how the data is placed on the clipboard.</p>

<p>Files may be dropped into the file list or the directory tree, from a drag initiated from
another application instance or from Windows explorer.  If dropped in the file list, we check
to see if they were dropped on a directory.  If so, we use that directory as target; if not, we
use the current directory.  When pasting (with <samp>Edit &gt; Paste</samp> or <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>),
the directory currently selected in the directory tree is always used as the destination.</p>

<p>The order in which files appear in a directory can be important, so an effort is made to
preserve the order when copying them.  However, directory entries need to come before any
entries that use them, to ensure that the appropriate hierarchy is established before trying
to create the files.</p>

<h3>Dragging in From Windows Explorer</h3>

<p>Files dragged from a Windows Explorer window are presented to CiderPress II as a list
of filenames.  This works like any other add/import operation.</p>

<p>The exception to this is when Windows Explorer is treating a ZIP archive as if it were part of
the filesystem.  In this case, the files are delivered as metadata and virtual file streams.
This mode of operation is not currently supported.</p>

<h3>Partial Pathname Handling</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an HFS disk image with the following set of files:</p>
<pre>
  MyDocs
    AddressList.csv
    FavoriteThings.txt
    FancyText.doc
  MyPhotos
    Rocks.jpg
    Family.gif
    Vacation
      Snow.jpg
      Resort.gif
</pre>
<p>If we copy these to the clipboard, what should the filenames be set to?  Specifically, if the
file list is just showing the contents of the "Vacation" directory, and we copy "Snow.jpg",
should it get pasted in Windows Explorer as "Snow.jpg", or under a couple of directories as
"MyPhotos/Vacation/Snow.jpg"?</p>

<p>The expected result of pasting or dropping the files in a different window will depend on how
the files were being listed in CiderPress II.  If the application was only displaying the contents
of the "Vacation" directory, it would be reasonable to drop the file as "Snow.jpg".  However, if
the application was showing the full file list, then the user would expect the directory
hierarchy to be preserved because that's what's shown on screen.</p>

<p>This is independent of the "strip paths" option, which always removes all paths.  For example,
when viewing just the "MyPhotos" directory, extracting the "Vacation" folder should extract
"Vacation/Snow.jpg" and "Vacation/Resort.gif".  With full paths those would further be stored in a
"MyPhotos" folder, while with stripped paths it would just create "Snow.jpg" and "Resort.gif" in
the target folder.</p>

<p>The behavior in the single-folder view matches Windows Explorer drag &amp; drop behavior,
because Explorer is effectively always showing a single folder.</p>

<p>Using the current view mode as the determinant of the behavior has one notable
drawback: CiderPress II always displays file archives in full-list mode.  While it's
possible to fully strip the directories with the "strip paths" option, it's not possible
to specify a partial path hierarchy.  (This could be resolved by synthesizing a directory
hierarchy for file archives.)</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this feature works the same way that "extract" does: files extracted
from the single-directory view will be "rooted" in that directory, but files extracted from
the full file list will be extracted with their full paths.</p>

<p>When files are copied between instances of CiderPress II, the receiving application also has an
opportunity to strip paths from the incoming files.  (The "strip paths" option is configured
separately for add operations and extract operations.)</p>

<h3>DOS 3.x File Handling</h3>

<p>There are two additional considerations when working with files on DOS disks: "raw" mode and
text file character conversion.</p>

<p>It's important to pay attention to the "raw files" setting when copying files from a DOS disk,
because it determines how the data will be formed on the clipboard.  It should generally be
enabled for DOS-to-DOS transfers and disabled for anything else.  Setting it on the receiving
side is not necessary, as the mode flag is passed along with the extended attribute data.</p>

<p>DOS text files have the high bit set on every character, while ProDOS and other filesystems
store text files with the high bit clear.  A conversion can optionally be applied when copying
and pasting files within or between instances of CiderPress II.  The conversion does not
affect files copied to or from other applications, such as Windows Explorer, but that can be
accomplished using the import/export text feature.  The conversion is only enabled when copying
to a filesystem, e.g. from DOS to ProDOS, ProDOS to DOS, or NuFX to DOS, but not DOS to NuFX.
The "Convert DOS Text" option must be enabled in the application settings on the receiving
side.</p>


<h2>Add/Extract vs. Import/Export</h2>

<p>CiderPress II uses "add" and "extract" to preserve file contents, and "import" and "export" to
convert file contents.  Both modes have their uses when dragging and copying, so we need a way to
tell the application which mode to use.</p>

<p>A simple button on the toolbar determines whether "extract" or "export" mode will be used.
Set <samp>Drag &amp; Copy Mode</samp> to <samp>Add/Extract</samp> or <samp>Import/Export</samp>
as needed.  The behavior is otherwise the same as it would be if that menu command were
chosen.  The various options can be set in the options bar on the right side of the window.</p>

<p>If the export conversion mode is set to a specific type, rather than "best", then only the
items suited for conversion will be exported.</p>

<p>When transferring files between CiderPress II instances, the mode must be set to "extract".  If
the mode is set to "export", the "direct transfer" data will not be placed on the clipboard.
Attempting to paste exported data into CiderPress II will result an error message.</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>Windows does not allow drag &amp; drop operations between applications with different privilege
levels when UAC (User Access Control) is enabled.  Windows Explorer does not usually run as
administrator, so if you run CiderPress II with elevated privileges, e.g. to gain access to
physical media, you may not be able to drag files in and out.</p>

<p>If no archive is open in the application, dropping a file from Windows Explorer into the main
application window will cause CiderPress II to try to open that file.</p>
