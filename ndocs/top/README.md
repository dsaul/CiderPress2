# CiderPress II # 

### **This is alpha-quality software.  Use at your own risk.**

CiderPress II is a software tool for working with disk images and file archives associated
with vintage Apple computers, notably the Apple II line and early Macintoshes.  It runs on
modern desktop and embedded systems.

The program allows you to perform various operations on files stored in disk images and file
archives: list, add, extract, import, export, copy, rename, move, delete, test, print, and
set attributes.  You can create new disk images in various formats and sizes, get metadata,
set metadata, copy blocks or sectors, edit blocks or sectors, and view raw tracks, as well
as copy and replace whole disk partitions.

For installation instructions, see the [install guide](Install.md).

**Current status:**
 - The command-line tool is alpha quality.  See [the manual](docs/Manual-cp2.md) for a thorough
   description of commands and features.
 - The GUI tool is alpha quality.  It's only available for Windows at this time, though
   emulation with WINE appears to be possible.
