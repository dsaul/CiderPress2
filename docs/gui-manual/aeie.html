<h2>Attribute Preservation Schemes</h2>

<p>Files stored in disk images and file archives have a number of attributes,
such as file types, dates, and access flags, that should be preserved when files
are extracted, and restored when files are added.  In some cases, the host filesystem
might not support all possible filenames, e.g. HFS allows a file called "Face/Off"
but Windows, Linux, and modern Mac OS systems won't allow it.</p>
<p>In addition, files used on the Apple IIgs and Macintosh may have resource forks. These
can be tricky to deal with because it means a single file entry can have two sets of
file data.</p>

<p>Five strategies are supported:</p>
<ol>
  <li>None - do nothing.  Resource forks, file types, and access flags
    are discarded when files are extracted.  File dates will be preserved if the
    host filesystem has something equivalent.  (Most filesystems record modification
    dates, but not all store creation dates.)</li>
  <li>AppleSingle (AS) - entries are stored as a single ".as" file.  This format
    defines a way to store the data fork, resource fork, original filename,
    and all file attributes in a single file.</li>
  <li>AppleDouble (ADF) - entries are stored as a pair of files.  The data fork
    is stored in a file with the original name, while the resource fork and
    any attributes are stored in an optional "header" file whose name starts with
    "<code>._</code>".  This can be convenient to work with, because anything
    that is only interested in the contents of the data fork can just read the
    file as it normally would.  The header file format is structurally identical
    to AppleSingle.</li>
  <li>NuLib2 Attribute Preservation Strings (NAPS) - this scheme encodes the file type
    and auxiliary type in the filename by appending a string like "#062000".
    Invalid characters are replaced with '%' escapes.  Data and resource forks
    are stored in different files; for resource forks, the appended string ends
    with "r".  This approach is fairly convenient, and was used to good effect
    by NuLib2 and the original CiderPress, but it can lose file dates and most
    of the access flags.</li>
  <li>Host-specific - for operating systems that natively support resource forks
    and extended file attributes, the values can be stored in the host filesystem.
    This is currently only available for Mac OS.  (Since the GUI app was written
    for Windows, this feature is only available from the CLI tool.)</li>
</ol>


<h2>Configuration Options</h2>

<p>The panel on the right side of the screen has a collection of configuration options
that affect add/extract and import/export operations.  These are presented here so that
they can be applied equally to operations started with menu items, copy &amp; paste
operations, and drag &amp; drop.</p>
<p>Options you can set when adding or importing files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>Recurse Into Directories</samp> - determines whether the application
    descends into the contents of selected subdirectories.</li>
  <li><samp>Use Compression</samp> - determines whether files added will be
    compressed.  Only meaningful for file archives that support compression.</li>
  <li><samp>Strip Paths</samp> - if set, partial paths will be stripped from
    files as they are added.</li>
  <li><samp>Raw</samp> - if set, file data forks will be opened in "raw" mode.
    This is only meaningful for DOS 3.2/3.3 files, and should only be used for
    files that were generated or extracted as "raw" data.</li>
  <li><samp>Preservation Handling</samp> - check the boxes to specify which file
    attribute preservation systems should be handled when adding files.  Normally all
    three should be checked, but if you wanted to, say, add an AppleSingle file as
    a ".as" file instead of adding its contents, you would uncheck the AppleSingle
    box.</li>
  <li><samp>Strip Redundant Extensions</samp> - if set, imported files will have
    any extraneous file extensions removed.  For example, when adding a ".txt" file,
    the file's type would be set to TXT or TEXT, and the ".txt" dropped from the
    filename.</li>
  <li><samp>Conversion Mode</samp> - when importing files, this determines which converter
    will be applied.  (Converters are not auto-selected for imports.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <samp>Conversion Settings</samp> button will open a configuration
window that lets you set the default parameters for importers.  For example, you can
specify which character set to use when importing text files.</p>

<p>Options you can set when extracting or exporting files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>Strip Paths</samp> - if set, files will not be extracted with subdirectory
    names.  Only matters for file archives and filesystems that store full pathnames,
    such as ProDOS and HFS.</li>
  <li><samp>Add Filename Ext to Exports</samp> - if set, a filename extension will
    be added to exported files.  For example, text files will have ".txt" appended
    to the filename, and graphics will have ".png" added.  This may be undesirable
    in certain situations, such as when extracting source code that already has
    meaningful extensions, such as ".c" or ".asm".</li>
  <li><samp>Raw</samp> - if set, file data forks will be opened in "raw" mode.
    This is only meaningful for DOS 3.2/3.3 files, and should be used when attempting
    to preserve the full file contents.</li>
  <li><samp>Preservation Mode</samp> - select one preservation mode to use when
    extracting files.</li>
  <li><samp>Conversion Mode</samp> - when exporting files, this determines which
    converter will be applied.  You can choose one specific converter, or select
    <samp>Best</samp> to have the program choose one for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <samp>Conversion Settings</samp> button will open a configuration
window that lets you set the default parameters for exporters.  For example, you can
specify the color mode for Apple II hi-res images.</p>

<p>The settings panel can be toggled out of sight with the <samp>Show/Hide Settings</samp>
button at the bottom right.</p>


<h2>Adding and Extracting Files</h2>

<p>To add files, select the <samp>Actions &gt; Add Files</samp> menu item.  Select
the set of files and directories to add, and click <samp>Select</samp>.  The
files will be added to the directory that is currently selected in the directory tree.</p>

<p>To extract files, select the files and directories you want to extract in the
file list, and select the <samp>Actions &gt; Extract Files</samp> menu item.  Navigate
to the directory where you want to extract the files, and click
<samp>Select Here</samp>.</p>

<p>If a file already exists, you will be prompted for permission to overwrite the file,
or skip add/extract of that one file.</p>

<p>The pathnames of extracted files can be affected by the current file list view mode.
For example, suppose you have an HFS volume with a subdirectory called <samp>Subdir</samp>
that has a file called <samp>MyFile</samp> in it.  If you're in single-directory view
mode, with <samp>Subdir</samp> selected in the Directory tree, extracting <samp>MyFile</samp>
will result in the creation of a file called <samp>MyFile</samp> in the chosen output
directory.
If you're in full-file mode, the file list shows all files on the volume, and will display
the file's partial pathname as <samp>Subdir/MyFile</samp>.
When you extract the entry, a subdirectory called
<samp>Subdir</samp> will be created, and <samp>MyFile</samp> will be extracted into it.</p>
<p>The rule is that the extraction process matches what you see in the file list.  You
can modify this by checking the <samp>Strip Paths</samp> option.</p>


<h2>Importing and Exporting files</h2>

<p>Import/export have the same general behavior as add/extract.</p>

<p>To import files, choose the desired conversion mode from the options panel.
Select the <samp>Actions &gt; Import Files</samp> menu item.  Select
the set of files and directories to import, and click <samp>Select</samp>.  The
files will be added to the directory that is currently selected in the directory tree.</p>

<p>To export files, choose the desired conversion mode from the options panel.
Select the files and directories you want to export in the
file list, and select the <samp>Actions &gt; Export Files</samp> menu item.  Navigate
to the directory where you want to extract the files, and click
<samp>Select Here</samp>.</p>

<p>If a file already exists, you will be prompted for permission to overwrite the file,
or skip import/export of that one file.</p>
