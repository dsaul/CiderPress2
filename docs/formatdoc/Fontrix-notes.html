<p>Fontrix was a desktop publishing application for the Apple II.  Developed by Data Transforms, Inc.,
it could generate large, detailed graphics ("16 times larger than the Apple screen"), combining
graphics with text rendered in custom fonts.</p>
<p>A series of "fontpaks" were released, each of which had ten fonts.  At one point the company
was offering $100 for submissions of original font designs.</p>

<p>Each font contains between 1 and 94 characters.</p>
<p>Character data is stored one bit per pixel, where 0 indicated background and 1 is foreground. Data
for each glyph is stored in byte order from left to right, top to bottom, with the left-most pixel
of each byte stored in the LSB.  Glyph data is referenced by a pointer into the file for each
character.  Fonts need not contain all characters; there are values identifying the first character
and number of characters included in the file.  Regardless of how many characters are included,
there are always 96 data pointers, representing ASCII values 32 through 127, although the first and
last characters are never defined nor used by Fontrix. Although there is not necessarily glyph data
provided for it, the offset for character 127 always points to the first byte beyond the glyph data
for character 126.</p>
<p>The glyph data is always mapped sequentially, and the width in bytes of a character can be
determined by the difference between its data offset and that of the following character,
divided by the given glyph height.</p>
<p>Offsets $0E2-$141 appear to potentially be the individual character widths for proportional fonts,
although further research needs to be done to confirm this.</p>
<p>The Fontrix font editor allows glyph cells to be 1-32 pixels wide, and 1-32 pixels high, inclusive.</p>
<p>The file format is:</p>
<pre><code>+$000 /  1: Unknown byte (usually $02)
+$001 / 15: Font Name, encoded in low ASCII, padded with spaces
+$010 /  1: Number of characters in file
+$011 /  1: ASCII value of first encoded character
+$012 /  1: Proportional flag.  0 = Non-proportional, 1 = Proportional
+$013 /  1: Non-Proportional font glyph width. For proportional fonts this seems to be an average.
+$014 /  1: Font height
+$015 /  1: Unknown byte
+$016 /  2: Font file size. This is little-endian encoded.
+$018 /  3: Identifier bytes.  All Fontrix fonts have a fixed sequence of $90/$F7/$B2 here.
+$01B /  5: Unknown bytes
+$020 /192: Character data offsets. 96 little-endian offsets from start of file. There are offsets
            for characters 32 (space) and 127 (del) although they are not used in Fontrix.
+$0E2 / 96: Unknown bytes.  These may be width or spacing data for proportional fonts.
+$142 / 62: Unknown bytes.  Usually 0 filled, sometimes junk text.
+$180 / nn: Character glyph data.
</code></pre>
<p>When editing a font, the font editor replaces the signature with its bitwise inversion ($6F/08/4D).
Files in this state can be found in fontpaks.</p>

<p>When creating a "GRAFFILE" with Fontrix, the space between glyphs is configurable, with a default
of one pixel.  Space characters aren't stored explicitly; rather, they're determined by "the size
of the last character accessed plus the size of the space between characters."  For a
non-proportional font that makes perfect sense, for a proportional font that can cause some
variability.</p>
