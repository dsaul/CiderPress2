<p>The file type notes have detailed information on all three formats, as implemented by
AppleWorks v3.0.</p>
<p>The AppleWorks v4 and v5 manuals have some useful information on updated features, but do not
document changes to the file formats.  Documents created with these versions of the application
may not be backward compatible to v3.0.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleWorks" rel="nofollow">AppleWorks</a> is an integrated office suite, combining
a word processor, database, and spreadsheet into a single application.  It was developed by
Rupert Lissner for Apple Computer, initially released in 1984 for the Apple II.  Shortly after
its release, it became the best-selling software package on any computer, with more than a
million copies sold by the end of 1988.  Support for the software was handed off to Claris, an
Apple subsidiary.</p>
<p>An Apple /// version was developed, but before being released it was sold off to Haba Systems,
which sold it as "/// E-Z Pieces".  Both programs used the same file format.</p>
<p>A series of enhancements were published by Beagle Bros with the "TimeOut" name.  Version 3.0 of
AppleWorks was developed by Beagle Bros, on contract from Claris.</p>
<p>Claris eventually lost interest in Apple II products, and licensed AppleWorks to Quality Computers,
which released v4 and v5 in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>AppleWorks GS shares little but the name with AppleWorks.  AWGS started out as GS Works, developed
by StyleWare, and was renamed after being purchased by Claris.</p>
<p>Claris developed integrated office suites for the Macintosh and Windows, called ClarisWorks.  After
Claris was absorbed back into Apple, the programs were renamed to "AppleWorks".  The original
AppleWorks is sometimes called "AppleWorks Classic" to differentiate it from the Mac/Windows
products and AWGS.</p>

<p>The three types of files have very different structures, but they all end with $ff $ff.  The
file type notes describe the file contents of v3.0 files in detail.</p>
<p>All multi-byte integers are stored in little-endian order.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">ProDOS Auxiliary Type</h3><a aria-label="Permalink: ProDOS Auxiliary Type" class="anchor" href="#user-content-prodos-auxiliary-type" id="user-content-prodos-auxiliary-type" name="user-content-prodos-auxiliary-type"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The 16-bit aux type is used to hold lower-case flags for the 15-character filename.  A '1' bit
indicates lower-case.  This has no effect for numbers, but a lower-case period ('.') is displayed
as a space (' ').</p>
<p>This is independent of the ProDOS filesystem lower-case convention, which was introduced with GS/OS.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Tags</h3><a aria-label="Permalink: Tags" class="anchor" href="#user-content-tags" id="user-content-tags" name="user-content-tags"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Version 3.0 formalized a tagged data extension, allowing arbitrary data to be appended to the
file.  Tags start after the file end marker ($ff $ff), and have the form:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 1: must be $ff
+$01 / 1: tag ID, assigned by Beagle Bros
+$02 / 2: data length in bytes, up to 2048
+$04 /nn: data
</code></pre>
<p>The start of the next tag immediately follows the data from the previous tag.</p>
<p>The last entry is special: +$02 is a count of the tags in the file, +$03 is $ff, and there is
no following data.</p>
<p>It's unclear which programs used this feature, or what the assigned IDs are.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element">Post-v3 Changes</h3><a aria-label="Permalink: Post-v3 Changes" class="anchor" href="#user-content-post-v3-changes" id="user-content-post-v3-changes" name="user-content-post-v3-changes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>v4 and v5 made numerous improvements, some of which require changes to the way data is stored.
Some newer files may not load correctly with v3.</p>
<p>v5 introduced support for inverse and MouseText characters.  These just use previously-unused
byte ranges.  The definition for character encoding becomes:</p>
<pre><code> $00-1f: special
 $20-7f: plain ASCII
 $80-9f: inverse upper case (map to $40-5f)
 $a0-bf: inverse symbols/numbers (map to $20-3f)
 $c0-df: MouseText
 $e0-ff: inverse lower case (map to $60-7f)
</code></pre>
<p>MouseText and inverse characters are available in Word Processor and Data Base files.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Data Base Files</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: Data Base Files" class="anchor" href="#user-content-data-base-files" id="user-content-data-base-files" name="user-content-data-base-files"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The basic file structure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable-length header.</li>
<li>Zero or more report records, 600 bytes each.  The original limit of 8 was increased to 20
in v3.0.</li>
<li>Standard values record.</li>
<li>Zero or more variable-sized data records.</li>
<li>End marker ($ff $ff).</li>
<li>Tag data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each data record is a series of control bytes, which may be followed by data.  The structure
generally has one entry per category:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: number of bytes in remainder of record
+$02 / 1: category #0 control byte
+$03 /nn: category #0 data
+$xx / 1: category #1 control byte
+$yy /nn: category #1 data
 [...]
</code></pre>
<p>The control byte may be:</p>
<pre><code> $01-7f: number of following bytes for this category
 $81-9e: number of categories to skip (value minus $80)
 $ff   : end of record
</code></pre>
<p>In the simplest case, the category data is a string, with the control byte providing the length.</p>
<p>There are special categories for dates and times, to allow them to be sorted correctly.  The first
byte of the category data will be $c0 for a date (high-ASCII '@'), and $d4 (high-ASCII 'T') for
time.  (It's unclear how this interacts with inverse/MouseText encoding in v5.  AW5 supports
four-digit years, so it's likely the date/time encoding system was revamped post-v3.0.)</p>
<p>Dates are stored in a 6-byte field, as <code>XYYMDD</code>, where X is $c0, Y and D are ASCII digits '0'-'9',
and M is a month code.  Month codes are 'A' for January, 'B' for February, and so on.  These are
displayed by AppleWorks in day-month-year format, e.g. "5 Jan 70".  If the year or day is <code>00</code>,
then that value is not specified (e.g. it's a list of people's birthdays without the birth year),
and the date should be displayed as "5 Jan" or "Jan 70".  This means that the year 2000 cannot be
represented directly.</p>
<p>Times are stored in a 4-byte field, as <code>XHMM</code>, where X is $d4, H is an hour code, and M are ASCII
digits '0'-'9' for the minutes.  The hour code is 'A' for midnight, 'B' for 01:00, and so on
through 'X' at 23:00.  AppleWorks displays times as 12-hour AM/PM.</p>
<p>The category-skip values are used to skip over entries that don't have data.  The control byte is
not followed by additional data for that category.  A skip value of 1 only skips the current
category.</p>
<p>These files can be represented as a spreadsheet-style cell grid, where each category is stored
as a column, and the top row holds the category names.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Word Processor Files</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: Word Processor Files" class="anchor" href="#user-content-word-processor-files" id="user-content-word-processor-files" name="user-content-word-processor-files"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The basic file structure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>300-byte file header.</li>
<li>Zero or more variable-sized line records.</li>
<li>End marker ($ff $ff).</li>
<li>Tag data.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three kinds of line records:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carriage return.  Records the horizontal screen position of the line ending.</li>
<li>Command line.  These are special commands that are displayed as a full line on screen,
e.g. changes to margins, justification, and spacing.</li>
<li>Text record.  This is primarily text typed by the user, but can contain mid-line formatting
commands as well, e.g. bold and underline.</li>
</ol>
<p>The type of each record is determined by the first two bytes.</p>
<p>Many of the features can be converted directly to Rich Text Format (RTF), which allows the
document to be imported into a variety of word processors.  A subset of RTF can be displayed
directly in a Windows RichTextBox control.  If the goal is simply to display the contents, rather
than convert for future editing, then converting the document to HTML might make more sense.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Spreadsheet Files</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: Spreadsheet Files" class="anchor" href="#user-content-spreadsheet-files" id="user-content-spreadsheet-files" name="user-content-spreadsheet-files"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The basic file structure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>300-byte file header.</li>
<li>Zero or more variable-length row records, each of which holds a sparse collection of cells.</li>
<li>End marker ($ff $ff).</li>
<li>Tag data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each row record is:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: number of bytes in remainder of record
+$02 / 2: row number, starting with 1
+$04 /nn: variable-length data, containing a series of cell entries
</code></pre>
<p>Each cell record is variable-length, and starts with a byte full of bit flags that provide
information about the contents and presentation.  The contents of the rest of the cell entry
vary based on the type.  Some cells hold labels, others hold formulas.  Formulas are tokenized,
using a single byte for math operators and spreadsheet functions.</p>
<p>Column references are output as a letter, starting with "A" for column 0, "AA" for column 26, up
to "DW" for column 127.</p>
<p>Numeric values are stored as 64-bit floating point values, using the Standard Apple Numerics
Environment (SANE).  These are equivalent to IEEE 754 values.</p>
<p>Performing small translations on the output can make it easier for modern applications to import
the generated output.  For example, cell ranges in AppleWorks are defined with a three-dot
ellipsis, e.g. <code>@SUM(A12...A18)</code>, but modern spreadsheets expect two dots ("..") instead.  Some
of the functions are commonly known by other names, e.g. <code>@AVG</code> is more commonly provided as
<code>@AVERAGE</code>.  A slightly more complicated issue involves making formulas more easily recognizable,
e.g. AppleWorks will use <code>(A12+A13)</code> as a formula, but a modern spreadsheet might expect that to
begin with <code>+</code> or <code>=</code>.  File format converters need to define the extent to which the original
content will be modified for the sake of modern usability.</p>
