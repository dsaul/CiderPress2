<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleLink" rel="nofollow">AppleLink</a> was an online service created by Apple
Computer.  Initially only available to employees and dealers, it was eventually opened to
software developers.  This was to be replaced by a system available to all users, called AppleLink
Personal Edition, but for various reasons the product evolved without Apple and was renamed to
America Online.</p>
<p>Files were stored in AppleLink Package Compression Format, which combined the data and resource
forks and file attributes into a single file.  This appears to have been a Macintosh-specific
format.</p>
<p>A separate format was designed for Apple II files on AppleLink Personal Edition.  These were
created and unpacked with the AppleLink Conversion Utility (ACU), written by Floyd Zink (who also
wrote BLU, the Binary II Library Utility).  The file format was assigned file type LBR/$8001, but
no file type note was published.  Files typically end in ".ACU".</p>
<p>ACU was a ProDOS 8 application, but included forward-looking support for features like resource
forks and non-ProDOS operating systems.  In practice it was only used for plain ProDOS files.</p>
<p>Files in ACU archives can be stored with or without compression.  The only supported algorithm
is SQueeze, a combination of RLE and Huffman encoding.  The format is the same as that used by
Binary II, but without the filename header.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">File Structure</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: File Structure" class="anchor" href="#user-content-file-structure" id="user-content-file-structure" name="user-content-file-structure"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Files have a header that identifies the file format, followed by a series of records.  Each
record has a header with the file attributes and CRCs.  The record contents generally reflect
the GS/OS view of file attributes, with 16-bit file types and 32-bit aux types.  All
multi-byte integers are stored in little-endian order.</p>
<p>The file header is 20 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: number of records in archive
+$02 / 2: source filesystem ID
+$04 / 5: signature "fZink"
+$09 / 1: ACU version number ($01)
+$0a / 2: length of fixed-size portion of file headers ($36)
+$0c / 7: reserved, must be zero
+$13 / 1: ? $DD
</code></pre>
<p>The header before each file is:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 1: resource fork compression method
+$01 / 1: data fork compression method
+$02 / 2: CRC of resource fork contents
+$04 / 2: CRC of data fork contents
+$06 / 4: blocks required to store resource fork on ProDOS
+$0a / 4: blocks required to store data fork on ProDOS
+$0e / 4: length of resource fork in archive (compressed)
+$12 / 4: length of data fork in archive (compressed)
+$16 / 2: ProDOS access flags
+$18 / 2: ProDOS file type
+$1a / 4: ProDOS aux type
+$1e / 2: ? reserved, must be zero
+$20 / 2: ProDOS storage type; $0d indicates directory
+$22 / 4: uncompressed length of resource fork
+$26 / 4: uncompressed length of data fork
+$2a / 2: create date
+$2c / 2: create time
+$2e / 2: modification date
+$30 / 2: modification time
+$32 / 2: filename length
+$34 / 2: CRC of file header
+$36 /nn: filename
</code></pre>
<p>The file header is immediately followed by the resource fork contents, and then the data fork
contents.  If there are additional records, the file header follows immediately.  There is no
padding for alignment.</p>
<p>The filename field holds a partial path.  For ProDOS, the components are separated by '/'.  It's
unclear how other filesystems would be handled.  Directories are stored explicitly, as zero-length
files with storage type $0D, though it's not known if their presence them is mandatory.</p>
<p>The compression method is $00 if the data is uncompressed, $03 for SQueeze.</p>
<p>Dates and times are in ProDOS-8 format.</p>
<p>The only Binary II field that doesn't appear here is "native file type", which could hold the
raw DOS 3.3 file type.  It's possible the reserved field at +$1e was set aside for that.</p>
<p>The operating system ID is based on the GS/OS FST definition.  It will always be $01 (ProDOS)
unless some other application generated ACU files.</p>
<p>The 16-bit checksum on the record header is a standard CRC-16/XMODEM that covers the first $34
bytes of the header, skips the CRC field, and continues through the variable-length filename
field.  The checksum on the file data is the same algorithm, but with a twist: it only seems to
match the calculated value for files up to 256 bytes long.  ACU will detect and report the damage
on a short file, but not on a long file.  It's unclear how the CRC is being calculated or whether
it has any value.</p>
<p>Some archives have extra data tacked onto the end.  This seems to happen when creating archives
with entries that failed to compress.</p>
