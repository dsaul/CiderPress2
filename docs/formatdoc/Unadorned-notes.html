<p>An "unadorned" disk image file is a series of 512-byte blocks, 256-byte sectors, or raw nibble
tracks, without any sort of file header or footer.  Such files can be identified by the
filename extension (.iso, .hdv, .po, .nib, etc.) and file length.</p>
<p>Block images are very straightforward: the file starts with block 0, which is followed by block 1,
and so on to the end of the disk.  Unadorned nibble images have fixed-length tracks, starting
with track 0.  Apple II 16-sector disk images are more complicated, because the order in which
sectors appear depends on the program used to create the image.</p>
<p>The contents of the disk image could be something simple, like a floppy disk with a DOS 3.3
filesystem, or it could be a multi-partition hard drive with multiple filesystems.  It could be
completely custom.  The only telling feature is that the file's length will be a multiple of 256,
512, or the nibble track length (usually 6656 bytes).</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">DOS vs. ProDOS vs. CP/M Sector Order</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: DOS vs. ProDOS vs. CP/M Sector Order" class="anchor" href="#user-content-dos-vs-prodos-vs-cpm-sector-order" id="user-content-dos-vs-prodos-vs-cpm-sector-order" name="user-content-dos-vs-prodos-vs-cpm-sector-order"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>(This section is only relevant for 16-sector 5.25" floppy disk images.  Larger volumes are always
created as blocks in ascending order, 13-sector floppies use physical sector order, and sectors in
embedded DOS volumes map linearly to blocks.)</p>
<p>DOS 3.2 disks used a simple scheme: if you request sector 5, you get sector 5.  This caused
some performance issues when reading multiple sectors consecutively, because by the time you
finished processing sector 5, the start of sector 6 had already passed by.  This meant the
system had to wait most of a full rotation before the next sector could be read.</p>
<p>DOS 3.3 introduced software "sector skewing".  The sectors were physically written in the same
order, but the sector numbers were remapped in software to match the performance characteristics
of the operating system.  This requires a lookup table.  Utilities that generate disk images
start from track 0 sector 0 and count up, using the skewed sector numbers.</p>
<p>UCSD Pascal and ProDOS/SOS use a different sector skew.  (DOS uses "-2" interleave, ProDOS
uses "+2".)  ProDOS disk utilities like ShrinkIt start from block 0 and count up, using the
skewed sector numbers.</p>
<p>If a CP/M utility created a disk image, it would use a third skew ("+3") for its 1KB blocks.  In
practice you are unlikely to find an example of this.</p>
<p>Version 7.x of the Copy ][+ disk utility created ".img" files with 16 sectors in physical order.
The feature was somewhat obscure, and did not support compression, limiting its usefulness.  It
was removed from later versions.  The feature was activated by trying to perform a whole-disk
copy to a drive that held a larger ProDOS volume.</p>
<p>When the filesystem code requests a particular block or sector, it's making a request with the
logical block/sector number.  We need to map that request to a physical sector number, based on
whether the filesystem is block-oriented or sector-oriented.  That gets converted to a track
offset based on the layout of the disk image file.</p>
<p>The ugly part of the process is that file extensions are unreliable or ambiguous, e.g. ".dsk"
could be block- or sector-order.  Sometimes files are named with the wrong extension.  Not only
do we have to scan the disk to see which filesystem is present, we have to do it multiple times,
once for every possible sector ordering.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the sector order is unrelated to the contents of the disk.  Disk images
with DOS filesystems can be in ProDOS order, and vice-versa.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Nibble Images</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: Nibble Images" class="anchor" href="#user-content-nibble-images" id="user-content-nibble-images" name="user-content-nibble-images"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>When creating an image of a non-standard (probably copy-protected) floppy disk, it can be
useful to create a nibble image instead.  These record the data read from the disk with minimal
processing.</p>
<p>There are two varieties of unadorned nibble image, both of which store 35 fixed-length tracks
from a 5.25" floppy disk.  ".nib" files record 6656 bytes per track, while the less-common
".nb2" files have 6384 bytes per track.  Both contain data read as octets from the disk
controller, with no attempt at preserving 9-bit or 10-bit bytes.  (The format is sometimes
referred to as NDO, or Nibble DOS Order, but that's misleading at best.)</p>
<p>Nibble images don't have the sector skew ambiguity that block/sector images have, because the
address fields on each sector identify the sector number.  While sector skewing must still be
handled, the file format is always "physical" order.</p>
<p>There may be some ambiguity in naming, e.g. sometimes they're called ".raw", or an image with
6384 bytes per track will be called ".nib", but the files must be 6656 * 35 or 6384 * 35 bytes
exactly.  The lengths are unlikely to be used for other formats.  (6656 * 35 / 512 = 455, so it
could be confused for a 227.5KB unadorned block image, but that's unlikely in practice.)</p>
<p>See the nibble file format notes for detailed information about the low-level track format.</p>
<p>The length of a track on a physical 5.25" disk is closer to 6384 than 6656.  This means that
a 6656-byte track either has very long gaps between sectors, or has some repeated data (hopefully
the former).</p>
<p>The length can present a problem for emulators when a floppy disk is formatted, because the ProDOS
format code will think the drive is spinning too slowly.  The approach used by AppleWin is to
write 336 zero bytes into a gap between sectors.  At first this seems like a problem, because
$00 isn't a valid disk byte, but in practice it just appears to the system as a 2696-bit
self-sync byte.</p>
