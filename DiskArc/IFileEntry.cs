// TODO(maybe): add an indexer for accessing file slots in a directory.  We might want

    // Implementation note:
    // Disk images and file archives are very different.  Simple filenames and partial paths
    // require different handling, and data compression affects file size reporting (including
    // whether or not they can even be known inexpensively).  It is tempting to split this class
    // into separate interfaces for disk vs. archive.
    //
    // In practice, files on DOS / ProDOS / HFS are very different from each other, as are files
    // in ShrinkIt / Binary II / ZIP.  The set of allowable file types, access flags, and the
    // possible range of dates in time stamps are all very different.  Even if we narrow the scope
    // to a single general category, we're still dealing with many implementation-specific issues.
    //
    // Splitting into filesystem vs. archive is more harmful than helpful, because having a
    // common way to reference a file entry can be very useful.
